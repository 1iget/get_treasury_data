# get_treasury_data
Code to download and parse XML files of U.S. Treasury auctions

The code can be run fully automated (with user input for securities / dates of interest) by downloading the `automate_script` file, running `run_scripts.bat` (answering the user input questions as needed).

Since this code has many dependencies to my computer (Windows OS, Google Chrome that has compatibility with Chrome Driver 2.35, the re software and relevent packages for R 3.3.3 and Python 2.7, appropriately specified Shell paths set up on your computer), realistically it is only an exercise for me in automation.

If you are interested in using this code on your own however, I recommend downloading the `automate_script` file, but open up the file `use_xml_parser.R` and follow the instructions in the code comments (you only need to change 5 values then download the necessary dates from a specified website).

Website coming soon!
